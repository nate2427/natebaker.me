### We Out Chea Tryna Function!

Yo! Welcome back to class. It’s your boy Nate, here to teach you some of that dat programming. Today we are looking at functions. You are gonna learn how to write out commands and pack them up in a procedure. Just like how numbers are data and strings are data, our compiled commands are data. The packaged list in the procedure, also becomes data. We are going to give it a reference, and that’s pretty much what a function is. It’s a procedure with a reference to it.

> In mathematics, we put the function in as ‘f(x)’ and whatnot. Y’all recall that. We all done did that. Just as you did those functions, with the right-hand side and the left-hand side, you’re going to use a similar concept in computer science. You are going to tweak the syntax a bit, but it’s all derived from what you have previously studied in mathematics. You are going to add parameters and the curly brackets, give it a name and bam! You got a function.

> > When you are defining a function in programming, you are going to put the variables like (X, Y) the same way you put in mathematics. When defining these variables, they are called parameters. However, when you have to call them (which means giving them a value) you name them ‘arguments’.

We are also gonna look at anonymous functions. Anonymous in our context means that it’s not tethered to a value nor is it described by an identifier. We looked at anonymous strings and values, but like these two, functions can also be anonymous. Once you given them an identifier, though, you got it all fixed up.
So, that’s pretty much what you want to know starting out. What functions are, how they are defined and how you can mimic a mathematical function in computer science.
